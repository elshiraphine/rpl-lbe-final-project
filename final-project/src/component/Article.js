                            when two blocks of the earth 
                            suddenly slip past one another.  
                            The surface where they slip is 
                            called the fault or fault plane. 
                            The location below the earthâ€™s 
                            surface where the earthquake 
                            starts is called the hypocenter, 
                            and the location directly above it 
                            on the surface of the earth is 
                            called the epicenter.</p>
